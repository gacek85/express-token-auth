# Express JS Token Authorization

This plugin registers as a middleware for Express JS framework's generated application. Performs a simple check for existance of an authorization token and validates it.
There are two options to authorize the request:

- [Static token](docs/token.md)
- [Dynamic token](docs/secret.md)
